## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS with SCSS Preprocessor
- CSS custom properties (via SCSS Variables)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive design
- Typography with Google Fonts
- Box Shadows and Backgrounds
- ARIA Accessibility Features

### What I learned

I gained a deeper understanding of building responsive layouts using **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**, which helped me structure content effectively across different screen sizes. I also improved my skills in writing **semantic HTML5 markup**, ensuring the code is accessible and well-structured. By using **SCSS**, I learned to utilize variables, mixins, and nesting to write cleaner and more maintainable styles. Additionally, I practiced implementing a **mobile-first workflow**, which reinforced the importance of designing for smaller screens before scaling up for larger devices. This project also enhanced my knowledge of **Google Fonts integration**, **box shadows**, and leveraging **ARIA attributes** for accessibility. Overall, this challenge was a great opportunity to refine both my design and coding skills.

### Continued development

I aim to refine my skills by exploring more advanced techniques in **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**, such as creating more complex layouts and animations. I plan to deepen my understanding of **SCSS**, focusing on reusable mixins and better structuring for larger projects. Improving accessibility is another priority, where I'll practice implementing comprehensive **ARIA roles** and ensuring compatibility with screen readers. Additionally, I want to adopt **JavaScript interactivity** to enhance user engagement and explore frameworks like **React** for dynamic content. Lastly, I will work on optimizing performance, including better asset management and minimizing CSS to create faster, more efficient web pages.
